Brian Kernighan Algorithm
What it does : Count 1s in a binary number

Basics :

If u understand below mentioned points then there is nothing left to learn in this algorithm

1.0s are called ‘unset bits’ in a binary number and 1s are called ‘set bits’
2.In programming languages identifier for a binary number is ‘0b’ as a prefix. for example : 0b00001010 represents 10
3.The most important point on which this algo is based
Subtracting 1 from a decimal number flips all the bits after the rightmost set bit(which is 1) including the rightmost bit.
:for example :
10 in binary is 00001010
9 in binary is 00001001
8 in binary is 00001000
7 in binary is 00000111
U can easily comprehend from the above binaries
All the programming languages have bitwise operator “&” which works as u would expect it to be
for example : 0b00001010 & 0b00001001 return 0b00001000
Combining point 3 and 4 if u run bitwise & operator on decimal number ’n’ and ‘n-1’ it removes the rightmost ‘set bit’ from n
