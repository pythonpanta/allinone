What is a datatype in python ?


simply , it represent the type of data stored in varibale or memory location
Datatype is a classification of data which tells the computer that how the programer wants to use the data. 
For example the data "hello" is different from the data 255.
Data "hello" is of type string and 255 is of type int in python.

In python, we can classify the data types into two.

Immutable data types
Mutable data types


Immutable data types
Immutable data type is defined as once we declare the data of a datatype then it will not allow us to modify it. 

The following data types are immutable data types in python.

bool - Boolean data type

is_number = True
is_valid = False

int - Integer data type
num1 = 100
num2 = 200

float - Float data type

num1 = 100.0
num2 = 220.5

str - String data type

first_name = "Anji"
last_name = "B"

tuple - Tuple data type

numbers = (1,2,3,4,5)

frozenset - Immutable set data type

unique_numbers = frozenset(1,2,3,4,5)



Mutable data types

Mutable data type is defined as it is a data type in which we can modify the data whenever we want.
 It's simply opposite to the immutable data type.
 
The following data types are mutable data types in python.

list - List data type or Array data type


data = ["Apple", 123.55, False]
set - Set data type

numbers_set = {1,2,3,4,5}

dict - Dictionary data type [i.e key value map]


days = {"Sun": 1, "Mon": 2, "Tues": 3}


In python we can also define our own data types as well.

The above mentioned data types are some of the built-in data types provided by the python.
