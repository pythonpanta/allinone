    Getting started...

    What is a program?

    A program is a sequence of instructions that tells how to solve a given problem. 
    For example, Finding a square of a number.




    Basic terminology of programming
        Input: Get data from the keyboard, a file, or some other device.
        Math: Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and multiplication.
        Conditional execution: Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate sequence of statements.
        Repetition: Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.
        Output: Display data on the screen or send data to a file or other device.
        Python installation.





        Before start programming in python, we have to install python software. 
        To install python software go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download and
        install the python software which is compatible with your operating system.

        Python program - "Hello World"

        print("Hello World")
        when we run the above code the python interpreter will give output Hello World.


        Python Indentation
        Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
        Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
        Indentation improves the code readability


        Python Comments
        Comments are used to explain Python code.
        Comments are used to make the code more readable.
        Comments are used to prevent execution when testing code.
        Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:


'''
print('Hello World')


# output : Hello World
